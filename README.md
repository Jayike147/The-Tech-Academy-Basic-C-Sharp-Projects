## C# and .NET Projects

This repository contains projects and exercises completed as part of my C# and .NET coursework, including web applications built with ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework.

### Skills Gained
- C# programming
- ASP.NET MVC web development
- Entity Framework for data access
- SQL Server integration
- Object-Oriented Programming
- LINQ queries

### Projects
- **Car Insurance Quote Web App:** Calculates insurance quotes based on user input.
By undertaking this course, I have learned the fundamentals of C# programming, object-oriented concepts, and how to build web applications using the .NET framework.
I believe I have also gained hands-on experience with ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and database integration, as well as practical skills in designing, coding, and deploying modern web applications.
As a developer, I plan to use C# and .NET to create robust, scalable applications for various platforms, including web, desktop, and cloud.
I especially enjoyed building the insurance project and database assignment, as well as seeing how all the components—models, views, controllers, and databases—work together.
This practical approach made the learning process engaging and has provided me the confidence to tackle future development challenges using C# and .NET technologies.
